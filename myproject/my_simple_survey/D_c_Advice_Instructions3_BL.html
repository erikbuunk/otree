   Part 2 -  Advice and Payment
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p>As announced, for each correct answer to a general knowledge question, you will be paid a piece rate of least
    {{Constants.low_pr}} GBP. To receive this piece rate, it does not matter whether you submitted a correct answer right away
    (in Part 1) or after you have sought advice (in Part 2). <br>  All that matters <i> to obtain this piece rate is that you
    ultimately submitted the correct answer to a question </i>. </p>

<p>For seeking advice there is an <b> advice fee </b> of <b> {{Constants.advice_cost}}</b> GBP per question. This fee will be deduced from your payment if you chose
    the advice option even if you ended up not changing your initial answer. If you proceed to the next question without
    seeking advice, you do not pay the fee. </p>

<p>The <b> piece rate</b> for correct answers is at least <b> {{Constants.low_pr}}</b> GBP but can also be higher: <b> {{Constants.high_pr}}</b> GBP per correct answer.
    The <i>computer</i> determines whether you receive the <i>low </i> piece rate of {{Constants.low_pr}} GBP or the <i>high </i>  piece rate of {{Constants.high_pr}} GBP per
    correct answer as follows:</p>

<p>It is <b><i>more likely</i></b> you will be paid the <i>high piece rate</i> than the low piece rate. Specifically, 8 out of 10 times the
    computer will select the high piece rate, and 2 out of 10 times, the computer will select the low piece rate. <br>
    In other words, the chance of getting the high piece rate is <i>80%</i>. </p>

<p>At the very end of todayâ€™s study, you will see an overview of your earnings and then find out whether the computer
    selected the high piece rate or the low piece rate for you. </p>

<p> Please press the "Continue"-Button to proceed. </p>
