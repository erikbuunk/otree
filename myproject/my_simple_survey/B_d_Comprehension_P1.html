  <div class="card card-body">

    {% if player.participant.quiztype == 1 %}
      <p>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of Arts and Literature.</p>
    {% elif player.participant.quiztype == 2 %}
      <p>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of Psychology and Linguistics.</p>
    {% elif player.participant.quiztype == 3 %}
      <p>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of Science and Technology.</p>
    {% elif player.participant.quiztype == 4 %}
      <p>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of History and Politics.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>The questions are structured in the following way: you will see a question and five possible answers one of which is
    correct. You can submit the answer to a question by selecting an answer option and submitting it by pressing the
    “Submit”-Button. Once submitted, you will not be able to return to a question and revise your answer.  </p>

    <p>For each <b>correctly answered question</b> you will receive a piece rate of at least <b>{{Constants.low_pr}} GBP</b>
    and potentially more.</p>

      <p><b>To answer each question</b>, you will have <b>{{Constants.answertime}} seconds</b>. A timer on your screen will
    show the remaining time (see the example above). Once you submitted an answer or the {{Constants.answertime}}
    seconds are up, you will automatically advance to the next question. </p>

    <p>If you do not submit an answer to a question within the {{Constants.answertime}} seconds, this question will not be evaluated for payment.
    Therefore, <i>even if you do not know the correct answer with certainty, we encourage you to submit the answer you
        consider most likely to be correct before the timeout.</i> Please do not forget to click the submit button after
    you chose an answer option.</p>

    <p>At the end of the study, you will learn how many questions you have answered correctly. You can also learn the
    correct answers for all the questions if you are interested.</p>

<p>The estimate you enter determines how accurate the computer program is supposed to be to be allowed to replace your
    answer. As you only want the computer program to replace your answer if it is <i>more</i> likely to submit a correct
    answer than yourself, you should enter your best estimate of how likely your own answer is to be correct. That is,
    reporting your most accurate guess of the chance that your chosen answer is correct secures you the largest chance
    of earning an additional {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP bonus.</p>

<p> In other words, if you think that the chance is <i>low</i> that you have submitted the correct answer, you should indicate
    this by entering a <i>low</i> number in the box, if you want to secure a larger chance of earning
    {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP. If, you think, however, that the chance is medium or high, you should indicate
    this by entering a medium or high number in the box to secure the largest chance of earning
    {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP from this part of the study.</p>
