{% if quiztype == 1 %}

<p><br>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of <b>Arts and Literature</b>.</p>

{% elif quiztype == 2 %}

<p><br>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of <b>Psychology and Linguistics</b>.</p>

{% elif quiztype == 3 %}

<p><br>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of <b>Science and Technology</b>.</p>

{% elif quiztype == 4 %}

<p><br>You will answer a sequence of 10 questions in the field of <b>History and Politics</b>.</p>

{% endif %}

<p>The questions are structured in the following way: you will see a question, a corresponding image and five possible answers one of which is
    correct. <br>
    You can submit the answer to a question by selecting an answer option and submitting it by pressing the
    “Continue”-Button. Once submitted, you will not be able to return to a question and revise your answer.  </p>

<p>For each <b>correctly answered question</b> you will receive a piece rate of at least <b>{{Constants.low_pr}} GBP</b>
    and potentially more. Further details on this will be given shortly. </p>

<p>The screenshot below shows an example of how a question will look like on your screen:</p>

{% if quiztype == 3 %}

 <div style="text-align:center">
<img src="{% static 'Employee/Example_SciTech1.png' %}" width ="60%" />
     </div>

{% endif %}

<p><b>To answer each question</b>, you will have <b>{{Constants.answertime}} seconds</b>. A timer on your screen will
    show the remaining time (see the example above). Once you submitted an answer or the {{Constants.answertime}}
    seconds are up, you will automatically advance to the next question. </p>

<p>If you do not submit an answer to a question within the {{Constants.answertime}} seconds, this question will not be evaluated for payment.
    Therefore, <i>even if you do not know the correct answer with certainty, we encourage you to submit the answer you
        consider most likely to be correct before the timeout.</i> Please do not forget to click the "Continue"-Button after
    you chose an answer option to submit it.</p>

<p>At the end of the study, you will learn how many questions you have answered correctly. You can also learn the
    correct answers for all the questions if you are interested.</p>

<p> Please press the "Continue"-Button to proceed.</p>
