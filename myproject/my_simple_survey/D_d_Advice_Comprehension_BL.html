    <p>For each of the 10 questions, you can decide whether you want the computer to remove <b>3 incorrect answers</b>,
    by clicking the button “Advice” on the screen. When you see the two remaining answer options, you can then choose
    the one you consider correct now. One of the two remaining answer options is correct. The answer you have chosen in
    Part I is highlighted.</p>

    <p> If you decide to seek advice, you will have <b>{{Constants.timeout_advice}} seconds to submit your new answer</b>. If you timed out with no new
    answer submitted, your initial answer form Part 1 will count for your payment.</p>

    <p>If you do not want to seek advice on a question, you can proceed by clicking the “Proceed”-Button instead. In this
    case, you cannot revise your answer to that question.</p>

    <p>As announced, for each correct answer to a general knowledge question, you will be paid a piece rate of least
    {{Constants.low_pr}} GBP. To receive this piece rate, it does not matter whether you submitted a correct answer right away
    (in Part 1) or after you have sought advice (in Part 2). All that matters to obtain this piece rate is that you
    ultimately submitted the correct answer to a question. </p>

<p>For seeking advice there is a fee of {{Constants.advice_cost}} GBP per question. This fee will be deduced from your payment if you chose
    the advice option even if you ended up not changing your initial answer. If you proceed to the next question without
    seeking advice, you do not pay the fee. </p>

<p>The piece rate for correct answers is at least {{Constants.low_pr}} GBP but can also be higher: {{Constants.high_pr}} GBP per correct answer.
    The computer determines whether you receive the low piece rate of {{Constants.low_pr}} GBP or the high piece rate of {{Constants.high_pr}} GBP per
    correct answer as follows:</p>

<p>It is more likely you will be paid the high piece rate than the low piece rate. Specifically, 8 out of 10 times the
    computer will select the high piece rate and 2 out of 10 times, the computer will select the low piece rate. In
    other words, the chance of getting the high piece rate is 80%. </p>

<p>At the very end of today’s study, you will see an overview of your earnings and then find out whether the computer
    selected the high piece rate or the low piece rate for you. </p>
