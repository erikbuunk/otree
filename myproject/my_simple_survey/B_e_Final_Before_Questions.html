<p>You have answered the three control questions correctly. </p>

<p>Reminder:</p>

<p>•	For each <b>correctly answered question</b> you will receive a piece rate of at least <b>{{Constants.low_pr}}
    GBP</b> and potentially more. </p>
<p>•	You will have {{Constants.answertime}} seconds to answer each question.</p>
<p>•	If you do not submit an answer to a question within the {{Constants.answertime}} seconds, this question will not
    be evaluated for payment. Therefore, <i>even if you do not know the correct answer with certainty, we encourage you
        to submit the answer you consider most likely to be correct before the timeout.</i></p>
<p>•	After you have submitted you answer to a question, you will be asked to indicate how likely it is that your
    chosen answer is correct (in %).</p>
<p>•	You can earn an additional {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP for these estimates.</p>

<p>Please press the “Continue”-Button to proceed to the knowledge quiz. </p>
