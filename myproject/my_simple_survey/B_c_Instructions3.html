<h4> Part 1 — Likelihood of having answered correctly </h4>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

<p><br>After you have submitted your answer to a question, you will be asked to indicate how likely
    it is that your chosen
    answer is correct. Below is an example. For providing your true estimate, you can earn
    additional
    {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP. </p>
<p>The screenshot below shows an example of how this task will look like on your screen:</p>

{% if player.participant.quiztype == 3 %}

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{% static 'Employee/Example_SciTech2.png' %}" height="110%" width="90%" />
</div>

{% endif %}

<h4>Your Estimate </h5>
    <p> For each of the 10 questions, you provide your estimate by entering an integer number
        between 0 and 100 into the statement: “I am __ % certain that
        my answer is correct.”. Higher numbers indicate that you assign your answer a higher a
        chance of being correct. </p>

    <h5> Payment Rule </h5>
    <p> At the end of the study <b>one</b> of your 10 estimates will be randomly selected and
        evaluated for payment. The selected estimate
        influences your chance of earning <b>{{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP</b> from this part of
        the study.</p>

    <p><i>*** The payment rule is designed such that you have the largest chance of earning
            additional
            {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP by reporting your most accurate guess of the likelihood
            that your chosen answer is
            correct.*** </i></p>

    <p>You will be awarded additional {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP if the selected answer to the
        question is correct.
        Yet, for this part either your answer or the answer of a special computer program will be
        used. </p>

    <h5> Computer Program </h5>
    <p> The program selects the correct answer with a certain likelihood that can be as low as
        “certainly the wrong answer is selected”
        (0 % likelihood) or as high as “certainly the correct answer is selected” (100 % likelihood)
        or any value in between
        0, 1, 2, 3, …., 97, 98, 99, 100%. Each of these 101 levels of accuracy of the computer
        program is
        <i>equally likely</i> and therefore there is only a 1/101 chance that the computer will
        select the correct answer
        with certainty. </p>

    <p>The estimate you enter determines how accurate the computer program is supposed to be to be
        allowed to replace your
        answer. As you only want the computer program to replace your answer if it is <i>more</i>
        likely to submit a correct
        answer than yourself, you should enter your best estimate of how likely your own answer is
        to be correct. That is,
        reporting your most accurate guess of the chance that your chosen answer is correct secures
        you the largest chance
        of earning an additional {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP bonus.</p>

    <p>If you would like to know more about the exact payment rule, this information is available at
        the end of the
        study. </p>

    <p> In other words, if you think that the chance is <i>low</i> that you have submitted the
        correct answer, you should indicate
        this by entering a <i>low</i> number in the box, if you want to secure a larger chance of
        earning
        {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP. If, you think, however, that the chance is medium or high,
        you should indicate
        this by entering a medium or high number in the box to secure the largest chance of earning
        {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP from this part of the study.</p>

    <h5> Further Remarks </h5>
    <p>Again, this task is <i>timed</i>. You will have {{Constants.confidencetime}} seconds to enter
        your most accurate estimate of
        the chance that your chosen answer is correct. If you did not submit an estimate before the
        timeout and this
        question was randomly chosen, you would be paid no additional GBP.</p>

    <p>What estimate is relevant for the award of the bonus will be determined only after you
        entered the estimates for all
        10 questions. As each question is equally likely to be chosen, you should treat each
        estimate as the one,
        that can earn you an additional {{Constants.confidence_pay}} GBP because this may be the
        case. </p>
